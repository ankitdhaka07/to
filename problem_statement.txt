Great! Hereâ€™s a slightly more challenging Node.js assignment that builds on your previous experience.

Assignment: Create a Simple Todo List Application with Express and MongoDB
Objective:
Create a Node.js server using Express that interacts with a MongoDB database to manage a Todo list. This application should handle basic CRUD operations.

Requirements:

Implement the following endpoints:
GET /todos - Retrieves the list of todos.
POST /todos - Adds a new todo.
PUT /todos/:id - Updates a specific todo by its ID.
DELETE /todos/:id - Deletes a specific todo by its ID.
Each todo should have the following properties:
id: A unique identifier for the todo (generated by MongoDB).
task: The task description.
completed: A boolean indicating if the task is completed.
Steps to Complete:

Setup MongoDB:

Install MongoDB on your machine or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Create a database named todoApp and a collection named todos.
Setup Express and MongoDB:

Initialize a new Node.js project.
Install the necessary packages: express, mongoose, and body-parser.
Define the Mongoose Schema:

Create a Mongoose schema and model for the todos.
Implement the Endpoints:

Implement the CRUD operations using Express and Mongoose.
